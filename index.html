			<p class="chapterone_intro">

				You may have encountered camp through <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em>, heard people toss it around when talking about films like <em>Pink Flamingos, </em><em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> or <em> Death Becomes Her</em>, or maybe you recognise it as the theme of the 2019 <em>MET Gala</em>. But what is camp <em> exactly</em>? Camp is a relatively established, though difficult-to-define term that knows its origins in queer subculture and slang. The easiest way to describe camp is probably to say that it is a sensibility, an attitude, a lens through which to view the world. But it’s also, without a doubt, something visual – <span class= "italic">think style, think aesthetic, think everything turned up to eleven</span>. Camp is excess. It is layered and polychromatic, it’s playful and ironic, yet, it’s serious in all of its extravagance.

				For some, to state that something is camp is to acknowledge that it is “so bad that it’s good” (yes, <span class= "italic">thank you</span> Susan Sontag), whereas for others it’s “so good” that it calls into question the very notions of good taste.

				To gain a better understanding of the aesthetic and sensibility that is camp, I think it’s about time we head on a little journey through its past. So buckle up, darling… we’re going for a ride!

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				Although camp as a concept didn’t have a clear label until much later, one of the earliest uses of the term can be traced as far back as 1868 when it appeared in a letter written by British theatre performer Fanny Park. Fanny, assigned male at birth, but presenting as female both on stage and off, wrote to her lover, Arthur; ‘I cannot echo your wish that I should live to be a hundred, though I should like to live a green old age – green! Did I say? Oh, ciel! The amount of paint that will be required to hide that very unbecoming tint! My “campish” undertakings are not at present meeting with the success which they deserve.’<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-2">[2]</a> The quote marks around the word <em>campish</em> indicate an awareness of the colloquial status of the term. Perhaps even more interesting, though, is the style and subject matter here, from the dramatic French exclamation <em>oh, ciel (oh, heavens)</em> to the fanciful thought of how much paint would be needed to cover up their skin if it turned green. This remains clearly recognisable as camp discourse to this very day.

				From tea time to further tensions, we’re crossing the pond babes!<span class="bold"> Next stop: 20th Century 'Murica.</span>

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				June 28, 1969. Early morning. We find ourselves at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar located in Greenwich Village, New York City. Several policemen enter, find bootlegged alcohol, and begin arresting and roughing up employees and patrons. Following the three-article rule, a regulation meant to prevent cross-dressing, anyone not wearing at least three articles of gender-appropriate clothing is taken into custody. It’s the latest in a series of police raids and tensions are running high. 

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				These tensions manifest in the fact that the patrons refuse to cooperate. Instead of leaving, they – joined by onlookers – form a crowd outside, waiting for their friends to be released. As the crowd watches the police mistreat patrons, anger rises. They start fighting back, throwing pennies, beer bottles, bricks and even setting trash on fire.

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				In a failed attempt to control the flames and disperse the crowd, the police grab a fire hose. But ✨surprise✨: the Stonewall doesn’t have running water, so there is no water pressure. The officers call in reinforcements and a line of policemen with nightsticks forms opposite the crowd. Among the rioters are several drag queens and trans women, said to have given the fiercest resistance. They start their own line, breaking into a spontaneous chorus line, complete with synchronized kicks, all while singing a rendition of Ta-Ra-Ra Boom-De-Ay:

			<p class="chapterone">
				The Stonewall Riots marked a significant shift in visibility. Before Stonewall, in a society where being openly gay was illegal and dangerous, people often had to search discreetly in libraries for information about homosexuality – information that, at the time, was mostly found in scientific literature that labelled it as a mental disorder. Within this context, camp served as a signifying practice – a discreet "code" that allowed gay men to communicate with each other, even while in the presence of potentially hostile individuals. After Stonewall and the subsequent rise of the gay rights movement, the attitude towards camp began to change. LGBTQ+ people, particularly in cities like New York and San Francisco, began to demand visibility, rights, and recognition. However, as the movement progressed, there was a growing desire among some of its members to be seen as "normal" and "respectable" within mainstream society. As a result, many gay men, in particular, no longer wanted to be associated with the flamboyance, excess, effeminacy and thus “outsider” status that characterized camp.
			</p>

			<p class="subtitle">

				It seems however, like we’ve missed an important step in our journey through the history of camp. <span class="bold">Time to rewind a little.</span>

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

        		Although camp has long been and still often is associated with white homosexual men, this leaves bare an important part of its history. In the 19th and 20th century, black people in the United States performed <em>prizewalks</em> or <em>cakewalks</em> at social gatherings on plantations; dance contests in which they would mimic and thereby exaggerate and mock the pompous and stiff movements of white slaveholders. The winner of such a contest was often awarded a cake, hence the name <em>cakewalk</em>.

      		<p class="chapterone">

       	 		Although Sontag famously described camp as 'disengaged' and 'apolitical', the cakewalks were anything but. They offered a subversive commentary on the racial power structures of the time. African Americans used these performances as a means of resistance – an act of defiance against a society built on oppression. As Paul Baker points out, the cakewalks were about sending a powerful message: “You will <em>never</em> break me.”<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-4">[4]</a>

     	 	</p>


      		<p class="chapterone">

        		Moreover, these cakewalks laid the foundation for the later Harlem Ballroom scene and ‘vogueing’, where trans women and queer people of color were at the forefront.

				<span class="bold">Rewind, fast-forward, and hit play – camp’s evolution through the 80s, 90s, and now!</span>
			
			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

        		In the 1980s, a new political wave rejected the notions of 'acceptance' and 'respectability' within mainstream society. Embracing queer theory and camp, activists used these tools to confront inequality within American culture. Amid the AIDS epidemic, camp became a form of defiance and resilience. At this point, a wider spectrum of people (those identifying not only as gay or lesbian, but also bisexual and transgender) began to organise themselves into action groups and terms like queer and LGBT+ were introduced. This obviously also entailed that more people were now able to take part in the camp sensibility. In the face of, or possibly because of, the conservative dominance of the decade, camp became increasingly vital.

        	The 90s, <em>again</em>, marked an era of an increased academic interest in the topic of camp, which was now expanded to include several subcategories. It gained a more serious status and was theorised, discussed and dissected at length. But, this almost over-analytical and very serious approach towards the topic also meant that it lost some of its fun and playfulness.         

      	</p>
				
      	<p class="chapterone">

        	As you might have noticed, the closer we get to modern times, the more complex camp seems to become. As queer people have gained more rights, acceptance and visibility (at least in some parts of the world), camp itself has also become more visible and has entered the realm of popular media. Bruce Labruce argues: "It's a sensibility that has been appropriated by the mainstream, fetishised, commoditised, turned into a commodity fetish, and exploited by a hyper capitalist system... what's lacking is the sophistication, and especially the notion of <em>asterism</em>, something shared by a group of insiders, or rather, outsiders." <a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-5">[5]</a>       

     	</p>

		<p class="chapterone">

			In the digital age, camp has furthermore taken a new turn with the influence of social media. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok allow for the rapid sharing of images, with memes and viral content further blurring the line between high culture and low culture and irony and earnestness.   

     	</p>

		<p class="chapterone">

			Katrin Horn suggests that today, camp is no longer defined by oppression but rather by “distortion.”<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-6">[6]</a> This distortion happens when commodified images of gay- or queerness are commercialised and absorbed into mainstream culture, stripping them of their original meaning, context and subversive power. This also happens with images of "strong women," which now serve as new forms of control rather than alternatives to outdated and repressive stereotypes.

				<p class="chapterone">
					
					Women have long been seen as passive subjects of camp rather than active participants in its creation. This can be partly explained by the fact that women, especially in the first half of the 20th century, were largely excluded from cultural production and had even less power to influence image-making processes – such as film, art, fashion and media – than gay men.<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-7">[7]</a> Yet, women seem to be central to the classical camp canon, with the figure of the diva playing a pivotal role. 
	
				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">
					
					In the mid-20th century, gay men channelled camp through “a select set of fabulous women, a sparkling collection of jewels, each one with a unique cut and colour.”<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-8">[8]</a> While gay men were heavily involved in various aspects of theatre at the time, the illegality of homosexuality made it difficult for them to land prominent roles. As a result, representations of gay men in mainstream media were scarce, leaving few role models with whom they could identify. One theory explaining the “symbiotic” relationship between gay men and their “fabulous women” is that these so-called divas served as stand-ins, embodying qualities gay men admired. They commanded attention and, not unimportantly, represented drama itself. It was the camp in these women — their excess, theatricality, and blend of feminine and masculine traits — that captivated gay men. Edward R. O'Neill adds that this fascination with divas stems from an appreciation for the act of performance itself; the identification with the labour, taste, and stylisation behind the creation of these larger-than-life figures.<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-9">[9]</a> Moreover, gay men saw in these women not only objects of admiration but also figures of survival – navigating societal pressures and struggles that resonated with some of their own experiences.

					As we have established, camp aesthetics have traditionally been considered to be the domain of gay men, who, in turn, have borrowed from women’s aesthetics and fashion – think of female impersonation, or the use of slang associated with “women's culture”; like the way gay men sometimes refer to each other using terms like “girl” or “she.” Pamela Robertson suggests that this exchange between gay men and women has long been perceived as being one-sided. Meaning: gay men are seen as appropriating feminine aesthetics and female stars, while women are not considered to draw inspiration from gay male culture. Robertson challenges this view by highlighting how certain female stars, such as Mae West and Madonna, have deliberately taken on aspects of gay male culture.

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">
					Looking at today’s icons – think Britney, Beyoncé, Gaga, Charli, Chappell – it’s clear that this is far from a one-way street, but rather a dynamic, two-way exchange. This raises important questions about appropriation, co-optation, and identity politics. Robertson argues that camp, as a sensibility embracing cross-sex and cross-gender identities, provides an important space to investigate these intersections, as well as the real differences between feminist and gay theory, and between gay women, heterosexual women, and gay men. Recognising camp furthermore helps us move beyond the simplified divide between “positive” (strong, independent, diverse) and “negative” (weak, stereotypical, reactionary) portrayals of women and sexual minorities. Katrin Horn argues that this divide often ends up reinforcing the marginalisation of lesbians and gay men, even in works that try to challenge it, by appealing to heteronormative views.<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-10">[10]</a>
				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					Of all the elements of popular culture, movies probably have the closest link to camp. In the 1990s, New Queer Cinema used camp not only to express queer theory’s deconstructionist ideas but also to visually distinguish itself from mainstream cinema. Although camp’s ironic and aesthetic sensibility is often associated with gay male culture – illustrated by filmmakers like John Waters – it also has a female counterpart: Dyke camp. Mikaella Clements writes, "Dyke camp is a movement directed not by the tastes of gay men but gay women: a specific brand of humor, manners, and sensibilities guided by lesbian identity."<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-11">[11]</a> While Dyke camp overlaps with traditional camp in some areas, it diverges in others. Where “traditional” camp revels in the love of artifice and the unnatural, Dyke camp instead focuses on the ultra-natural, nature built up and reclaimed, of clothing that could be extensions of the body, of compulsive yearning, of lesbian gestures or mannerisms multiplied by a thousand. Dyke camp, like its gay male counterpart, embraces iconic figures like Katharine Hepburn (I mean, the pantsuits, need I say more?), but also includes expressions such as Janelle Monae's pink vagina pants, Thelma and Louise soaring through the air in their getaway car, the theme song from The L Word and the hyper-specific costumes featured in the “I Hate Gay Halloween” trend.

					A camp film that I’m personally quite fond of is the 1999 low-budget film <span class="italic_cen">But I’m a Cheerleader</span>, by female director Jamie Babbit. It features a bright colour palette (largely consisting of various shades of pink and blue), plenty of pompoms, vaginal motifs in artwork and decorating, two ex-ex-gays running what is referred to as the ‘underground homo railroad’, and, of course, RuPaul in tight shorts and a blue shirt featuring the words “Straight is Great” in bold sans-serif. Seriously, what’s not to love here? 
	  
				</p>
				
				<p class="chapterone_cheer">

					The film's premise seems rather bleak at first: a girl is sent to a conversion therapy camp (yes, that’s right. Not only is this film camp, but it also takes part in an actual camp context) by her parents, who accuse her of being a lesbian. Why? Well, she is a vegetarian, has pictures of women around and – heaven forbid – doesn’t like to kiss her boyfriend (in all honesty, who would? The guy practically attacks her with his mouth agape and tongue sticking out, you’d have to see it to truly appreciate how horrifying it is). 

				</p>
			
				<p class="chapterone_cheer">
					
					As the story unfolds, it quickly becomes clear that the film is more interested in poking fun at the dull, beige and brown world of ‘normal’ or ‘straight’ society – and at the very idea of sending gay teens to conversion therapy, with other gay teens (what could <span class="italic_cen">possibly</span> go wrong?!) – than at the lesbian and gay teens who deviate from it.

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone_cheer">

					While the girls learn to scrub floors, do dishes (while wearing pink gloves and using rose-shaped dish brushes – <span class="italic_cen">naturally</span>), manicure their nails, change diapers and sit properly (sat up straight, with one leg elegantly crossed over the other, rather than slouched over and with their legs far apart (<span class="italic_cen">oh, no! not the manspread!), the boys are taught to fix cars, chop wood, spit and play sports.

				<h2 class="intro">Drag and Dresses: Femininity and Camp</h2>

				<p class="chapterone">

					A key element of camp is transgression, stepping outside what’s considered normal, and in doing so, breaking expectations (often unspoken) around how different people should behave, look, or sound.<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-12">[12]</a> A prime example of this can be seen in the camp figure of the drag queen. But, how exactly do we define a drag queen? The Cambridge Dictionary offers the following definition: a person, often a gay man, who dresses in highly decorated women's clothes, wigs, jewellery, make-up, etc., as a costume and performs as a woman for entertainment. While this definition holds up in a basic sense, I believe it’s also what has led some feminists to criticise drag, arguing that it’s simply men "pretending" to be women for laughs, thus turning women into the butt of the joke – and, by extension, reinforcing misogyny. 

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					I understand where this criticism comes from, but I think it overlooks an important point. Drag isn’t simply about impersonating or mocking women; I would rather argue that it’s a way of exploring and challenging gender roles and stereotypes, through enacting playful subversions of aesthetic and gender codes. In some of its forms, drag could even be viewed as a challenge to patriarchy, or at least to heteronormativity. Moreover, this criticism fails to acknowledge that drag is very diverse – drag encompasses a wide range of performances and identities. However, it’s still true that drag kings don’t receive the same recognition as drag queens, which is probably partly linked to the idea that mocking men (or masculinity) doesn’t have the same comedic or cultural power as mocking women (or femininity). 

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">
			
					RuPaul’s Drag Race has played a significant role in shaping the mainstream understanding of drag. The reality competition show, where contestants are judged on Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent (it’s Drag Race, so yes, the acronym is indeed very much intentional), has been criticised by some for commercialising drag. On the flip side, Drag Race has definitely contributed to an increased visibility and acceptance of queerness and drag. The fact that the show has expanded much beyond its intended gay male audience additionally forms yet another indicator that camp humour has become mainstream. 
				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					Drag Race has, however, received criticism for its attitude towards trans people; think of the use of terms like ‘tranny’ and ‘she-male’ on the show or how trans people weren’t allowed to compete until relatively recently. When asked about this in 2018, RuPaul stated that he probably wouldn’t have allowed a contestant who had transitioned to compete.<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-13">[13]</a> Drag queens are meant to be witty and a little offensive or, as they put it, fishy. And it's precisely because of their stylised and exaggerated drag personas that they can push boundaries in ways they wouldn’t be able to outside of drag – I believe this is also part of what makes them so entertaining. But, this is also where camp humour in the 21st century becomes tricky: when is something genuinely funny, and when does it cross the line into being degrading or hurtful? RuPaul admits: “Drag is dangerous. We are making fun of everything. But when someone doesn’t get the joke or feels offended by it, it’s a lose-lose situation, because you can’t explain a joke. It isn’t funny if you explain it.”<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-14">[14]</a>

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">
					To make things even more complicated, this short exploration of drag wouldn’t feel complete without acknowledging the existence of female drag queens<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-15">[15]</a> (even less represented) and a relatively new addition to the drag scene. This leaves us with an enjoyable mess to sort out; these are women acting as what would have been a guy acting as a woman, at least historically. How do they view their position within drag themselves? British female drag queen Hollester points out that while feminism has made great strides for women, it has also suppressed opportunities for women to be camp. In turn, fellow queen Miss Malice explains how drag gave her the opportunity to challenge a society that labels femininity or being femme as weak or frivolous, and that suggests smart or feminist women shouldn’t wear long nails or lipstick.<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-16">[16]</a>

				<p class="chapterone">

					Moving from drag to more “everyday” attire, I would like to highlight a fragment of an interview with Billy Porter that I saw a while back and that was quite eye-opening for me. To set the scene: Billy is a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, where Colbert asks him whether he believes fashion is political. He responds that it can be and goes on to discuss fashion’s complex relationship to gender; “We’ve moved beyond the idea that women wearing pants is a problem… Women wearing pants is powerful, it’s strong, everybody accepts it. And it’s associated with the patriarchy, it’s associated with being male. The minute a man puts on a dress, it’s disgusting. So what are you saying?” He continues: “Men are strong, women are disgusting. I’m not doing that anymore. I’m done with that. I’m a man in a dress, and if I feel like wearing a dress, I’m going to wear one.”<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-17">[17]</a>

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					So, to briefly summarise: Dressing like a man (meaning: wearing what is traditionally considered to be male attire; think pants, suits, maybe a cheeky tie) 'elevates' a woman, since it’s associated with power and masculinity, whereas a man dressing like a woman (again, wearing what is traditionally considered to be female attire; think dresses, skirts,  ruffled blouses, make-up) 'lowers' him to the level of a woman, reinforcing the patriarchal idea of women's status as inferior. Although this now seems so obvious to me, I think this is the first time I’ve heard someone articulate it so clearly. 

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					That being said, I want to clarify that I'm by no means saying we should all swap pants for dresses and skirts. Instead, I'm proposing that we critically reflect on the societal messages we associate with femininity and masculinity, and question the power dynamics embedded in these gendered expectations.

				<h2 class="intro">Can the camp be feminst? </h2>


				<p class="chapterone">

					But, how do we bring camp, the feminine and the feminist together? First, I propose we get our basic facts on feminism straight. Feminism is based on the idea that all genders should have equal rights, opportunities and treatment and originated from the disadvantaged position of women in society. The history of feminism is often divided into different movements or "waves," with the wave metaphor being used to characterize and differentiate various eras and generations of the movement. However, this metaphor isn’t perfect; it has been criticised for being somewhat reductive, as it suggests that feminism is a unified movement with a single set of ideas, while often overlooking the diverse and conflicting views within it. The wave metaphor also tends to downplay the continuity between movements, making it seem as though only mainstream feminism is significant, while ignoring various splinter movements. Yet, it does remain a helpful tool for understanding the development and history of feminism. So, (slight sigh), here we go:

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					The first wave (mid/late 19th century - early 20th century) was mainly concerned with legal rights, primarily women's suffrage – the right to vote. But, it also worked toward securing property rights, access to education and improved work opportunities for women.

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					With the catchphrase "the personal is political," the second wave of feminism, which spanned approximately from the 1960s to the 1980s, focused on a wide range of issues, including relationships, domestic work, reproductive rights and bodily autonomy, while also challenging systemic sexism ingrained in institutions and everyday life. Although rooted in anti-racist civil rights movements, the women’s movement remained primarily catered to white, middle-class women, and women of colour were often pushed to the margins. 

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					So, what did the second-wave gals have to say about femininity? Well, let me tell you. They saw femininity as a set of traits and behaviours imposed on women by a patriarchal society, reflecting their subordinate status to men. In this view, femininity is defined by men, and women are conditioned to embody it as a submissive counterpart to male power. Given this understanding, it is no surprise that femininity was seen as a barrier to liberation; it was viewed as something that didn’t benefit women and, therefore, needed to be resisted and defeated. <a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-18">[18]</a>

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					Alright, on to the third wave. The third wave of feminism, emerging in the 1990s, built upon the work of theorists from the 1980s, such as Kimberlé Crenshaw and Judith Butler. Intersectionality – a term coined by Crenshaw, which highlights how various forms of oppression, such as race, gender, class, and sexuality, overlap and intersect – becomes more mainstream. This pushes ‘mainstream’ feminism to become more inclusive and attuned to the diverse, often marginalised, voices that had previously been largely overlooked.

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					So, how did the third wave view femininity? The third-wave perspective contrasts that of the second wave, by understanding femininity not as solely imposed on women or embodied by women, but rather as something that is available to and can be embodied or performed by anyone. This definition of femininity draws on Judith Butler's analysis of gender as socially constructed, relational, and performative. Third-wave feminism does recognise the pressures on women to conform to what can be seen as submissive forms of femininity but simultaneously emphasises how women may collectively deploy transgressive forms of femininity or counter-hegemonic<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-19">[19]</a> meanings of 'girly things' as tools to disrupt gender hierarchies.<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-20">[20]</a>
				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					In this way, femininity is regarded as something that can be performed – an action, not an inherent quality – offering a means of resistance rather than simply a barrier to liberation.

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					Feminism and queer liberation movements are deeply interconnected, both challenging patriarchal and heteronormative systems that rigidly define gender roles. However, they are often treated as distinct, separate movements. This is a false division. At the root of both misogyny and homophobia lies a shared devaluation of femininity. Those who embody femininity – especially individuals who don’t conform to traditional gender norms – are often dismissed.

				</p>

				<p class="chapterone">

					And, here, we arrive back with our dear old friend, camp. Within the context of feminism, camp is interesting because it offers a form of gender parody. Camp mimics and exaggerates gender norms and by doing so reveals their performative nature; gender as something that is learned and constructed by society rather than natural or inherent.

				<h2 class="intro">And the Category is: Subversion and (Re)appropriation</h2>

				<p class="chapterone">

					Subversion, the act of challenging, dismantling or destroying established systems of power, serves as a form of resistance, an effort to reclaim, remake, recontextualize and thereby  rewrite dominant narratives. Camp itself can be understood as a subversive tool. While camp can be intentional, it’s not always so, and it’s most certainly not solely the creator’s domain. Camp is often employed as a “queering device” on the observer's side, a tool to break into and deconstruct “mainstream” culture. As Juan Antonio Suarez describes it, camp expression is not only "adventures in taste as much as war cries, expressions of protest from communities actually claiming social and cultural spaces forcibly denied to them."<a class="reference" data-footnote="footnote-21">[21]</a>

				<h2 class="intro">Final Pose </h2>

				<p class="chapterone">
					Before starting this project, I had a “general” understanding of camp – a term that I’d use among friends; a shared subtextual understanding of media and culture. It was something that had been a part of my youth and teens (though, admittedly, I had no idea what to call it at the time). From my love for ABBA and their ridiculously campy outfits, to Mamma Mia! (the original – obviously. The sequel doesn't come remotely close in terms of fun and campiness), to a later appreciation for pop icons like Lady Gaga and David Bowie, and in more recent years, an appreciation for campy films, drag and – dare I say it – campy online discourse.
